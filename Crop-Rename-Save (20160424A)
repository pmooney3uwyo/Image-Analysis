# The following script will crop all .tif files located in the current working directory, without regard to image size.  
# Here I have provided an example of how to define the current working directory: os.chdir('/users/paultmooney/desktop/20160424 laptop/test images')
# The original image is divided in half along its vertical axis and both halves are saved as new files.  
# An example of the application of this script would be to separate donor, acceptor, and raw FRET channel images acquired using simultaneous imaging systems (e.g. Photometrics DualView 2) during FRET microscopy.
