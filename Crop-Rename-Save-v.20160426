# The following script will modify all .tif images in a given folder such that they are divided in half along their vertical axis.
# To use this script you need to edit line #8 such that it corresponds with the location of your .tif images
# An example of the application of this script would be to separate donor, acceptor, and raw FRET channel images acquired using simultaneous imaging systems (e.g. Photometrics DualView 2) during FRET microscopy.
